Stock Span PROBLEM
========================================================================================================================================================================
Afzal has been working with an organization called 'Money Traders' for the past few years. The organization is into the money trading business. His manager
assigned him a task. For a given array/list of stock's prices for N days, find the stock's span for each day.
The span of the stock's price today is defined as the maximum number of consecutive days(starting from today and going backwards) for which the price of the stock was
less than today's price.
For example, if the price of a stock over a period of 7 days are [100, 80, 60, 70, 60, 75, 85], then the stock spans will be [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6].

#include<stack>
int* stockSpan(int *price, int size )  {
    int *spanarray=new int[size];//new array created
    stack<int> st;//creating a stack
    spanarray[0]=1;//we will initialise the 0th index as 1 since no element will be less than tthe preveious leement
    st.push(0);
    
    for(int i=1;i<size;i++)
    {int ans=1;
        while(!st.empty() && price[st.top()]<price[i])
        {
            ans=ans+spanarray[st.top()];
            st.pop();
            
        }
        spanarray[i]=ans;
     st.push(i);
    }
    return spanarray;
    
}
